# Course Project for the Coursera (Getting and cleaning data)

## I am creating a R script with the name of run_analysis.R to do:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names and 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity     and each subject.

## The corresponding data was downloaded from the Coursera "getting and cleaning data" course where the link is
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

first, the directory was set where the corresponding data was downloaded and then the run_analysis.R file was saved where the directory is set. By doing this, one can easily run the run_analysis.R code and get the result. 
It is worth mentioning that in the R code, we are installling two packages too to be able to run the code.
